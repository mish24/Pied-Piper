A socket based program to send a file over the network after dividing it into parts and sending each part separately.

**Woah. Why man?**
This replaces the usual emailing method. The usual one has a size limit on the file that has to be sent. If the size is too much,
you get to share it on the Google Drive only right?
And you can only upload the second file once the first one is uploaded. Shyash. 

**An insight?**
Not getting that. 

**What the hell will I do with these files?**
First compile the .java files and create a jar file. Simply run this jar file. One user becomes the host and other one is special
to get a request to join.

**If you use this, send me love back. (I love gifts)**
